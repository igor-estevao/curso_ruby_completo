Before moving forward you will need to install the Ruby programming language and the Ruby on Rails framework (5 and/or 6) at this time, take a look at the sections noted below for step by step walk-through of the installation process (along with all the dependencies and familiarization) based on your machine:

1) MacOS local installation - Section 13

2) AWS Cloud9 (cloud-based IDE) - Section 14

3) Windows installation - Section 15

You can choose either of the 3 options above and if you find the local installations (Mac or Windows) a bit difficult or run into issues which you are unable to resolve, then give the AWS Cloud9 web-based IDE a try since it's the easiest to get started with.

These sections will also cover environment specific terminal/command-line/PowerShell familiarization and usage, which will be very important from this point onward so don't miss/skip it.
