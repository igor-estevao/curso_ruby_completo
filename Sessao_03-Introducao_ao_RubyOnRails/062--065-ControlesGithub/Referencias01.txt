Upon download and installation in your local machine (AWS Cloud9 comes pre-installed with Git), first time setup steps are required (only one time) for your git installation (for all environments):

git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
replace "Your name" and youremail@example.com above with your actual name and email address which you want shown on your repos.

To display git config settings, use the following command:

git config --list

Some useful git commands:

Your rails application already comes initialized with a Git repository. But if you have to initialize a git repository for an application you are working on, you can use the following command (do this from within the application directory):

git init

Note: if using Rails 5 or above, your application will already come with a git repository initiated, if you initiate a new one, it'll simply do the same step again.

To add/track all files, use the following command:

git add -A

To commit changes/updates/additions to repository, use the following command:

git commit -m "A useful message to help remember details of commit"

To check current state of file updates with already tracked/committed code in repo, check git status with the following command:

git status

To reject latest changes, you can use the following command:

git checkout -f
