You can sign-up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/

Once signed-up, you can follow the steps in the video to create a new repository for your application.

If you chose SSH as the option to push existing repo, you will need to set up an SSH key unless you already have one.

To display your public SSH key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If you don't have an SSH public key or are not sure, checkout the instructions here: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

When creating a GitHub repo for your application, you can click on the SSH button, then push existing repo:

git remote add origin git@github.com:yourgithubaccountname/test-app-6.git

git push -u origin master # Remember you only need to use this command the first time

To view remotes setup in your environment (from your app directory):

git remote -v

For future pushes to repository:

git push origin master
